To Do

These components are not necessarily listed in the order they need to be
implemented:

* Filtering functionality (:ref:`filters`)

  * Language detection filter

* Allow clients to extract sub-results from a result doc (using JSON paths)

* Add template Queries

* Add tagging of ElasticSearch documents based on transform results

* :ref:`Transforms`

  * Co-Clustering

  * LDA

* Validate configuration pieces based on a schema, specific to
  each filter/transform

* JS client library (possibly hook in with ``pyes``)
  E.g. to be used by the admin interface.

* Admin interface

* Python client library (possibly hook in with ``pyes``)

* Online service for ad-hoc requests

  * Define online API (Client/server? JVM using Jython etc.?)

  * Integrate a fast clustering algorithm for this
