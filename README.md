# Grouperfish

#### A Document Transformation Engine

The nascent Grouperfish project aims to provide a simple, online, scalable text clustering solution as a REST/JSON service. Initially this service is needed to drive sites and themes for [Firefox Input](http://input.mozilla.com), as described in [mozilla bug 629019](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=629019). 

The main service is written in Java. Individual algorithms can use varying technologies and platform.
